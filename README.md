# EmployMe

# My Capstone Project - EmployMe


# How would I like to improve the world?
my vision is to bring the employer and jobseeker together  on the platform where the recruiter would post the job according to his needs and  the jobseeker can navigate through all the jobs posted and find the best suitable match for him depending on his skill sets and apply for that particular job



# Why is this a problem?
In todays highly inter-connected world there are many platforms which offer more or less similar services of bringing jobseekers and employer on the same table but the thing is that they have some drawbacks like they charge you a lot for using the platform or bringing the best possible search or have some subscription based model which an unemployed youth cant afford along with this some platforms are filled with unverified employers with some other vested interests not good for the job seekers , unnecessary ads are also an headache for the people , all this thing needed to be addressed




# My Potential solutions ?
considering all the issues above my platform would focus on

giving the best possible user experience 

affordable services

user friendly UI

quick customer support 

verified employers
